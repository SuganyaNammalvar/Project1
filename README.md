# PWC-Customer Churn Dashboard


## Problem Statement

Extracted customer demographics and insights for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs.

Following tasks are:

.Define proper KPIs.

.Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs.

.Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed.

.Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

.Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical.

.Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : In this dataset,it has 23 columns and 7043 rows.
- Step 5 : Added additional conditional column named "Loyalty".Formula is "if tenure is less than 12 then output will be < 1 year"
and so on ..

- Step 6:Remove unnecessary rows and columns 

- Step 7 :Each of the column were validated under the correct data type.
- Step 8 :Close and load into PowerBI.
